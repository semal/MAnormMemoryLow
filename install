Unix-like OS (UNIX, Linux, or Mac OS X):

1. Extract MAnormFast.tar.gz by typing on the command line;
$ tar xvf MAnormFast.tar.gz

2. Enter the folder created by tar (i.e. ./MAnormFast) and type the following on the command line.
$ cd MAnormFast
$ sudo python setup.py install

Note that the installer must have the proper security privilege to install MAnorm at /usr/local/bin; otherwise, the user can install MAnorm at the home as follows.
$ python setup.py install --prefix=$HOME
where $HOME stands for the user's home. Then, add a line to the log-in shell script (i.e. .bashrc in case of bash shell)
export $PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/lib/python2.7/site-packages
export PATH=pathOfMAnormFast/bin:$PATH
